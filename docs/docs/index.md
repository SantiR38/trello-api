By **Space-x**.

In this site you will find all the needed documentation to undestand all the functions of the API.


If you want to see the docs in web format, you'll have to do some steps.

1. Execute in terminal `docker-compose -f local.yml up docs`. This will create the `_build` directory with all the web structure for the docs.

2. Download and install `ritwickdey.liveserver` extension for VS code. If you have another editor, search for another live server.

3. Open the `docs/_build/index.html` file in VS Code. Press "Go Live", and automatically the browser will open the docs in web format.
