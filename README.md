Documentation
-------------

The official documentation of this project is located in
**docs/\_build/index.html**, but before looking for it, you\'ll have to
do some steps.

1.  Execute in terminal `docker-compose -f local.yml up docs`. This will create the `_build`
    directory with all the web structure for the docs.
2.  Download and install `ritwickdey.liveserver` extension
    for VS code. If you have another editor, search for another live
    server.
3.  Open the `docs/\_build/index.html` file in VS Code.
    Press \"Go Live\", and automatically the browser will open the docs
    in web format.
