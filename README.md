Documentation
-------------

The official documentation of this project is located in
**docs/\_build/index.html**, but before looking for it, you\'ll have to
do some steps.

1. Download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2.  Execute in terminal `docker-compose -f local.yml build` and `docker-compose -f local.yml up docs`. This will create the `_build` directory with all the web structure for the docs.
3.  Download and install `ritwickdey.liveserver` extension for VS code. If you have another editor, search for another live server.
4.  Open the `docs/\_build/index.html` file in VS Code. Press \"Go Live\", and automatically the browser will open the docs in web format.
5. Enjoy my docs made with love... ðŸ˜Ž
